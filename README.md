# <Notes-Saver>

## Description

This application was built for the purposes of creating a note saver application. This application can allow you to type in a note title and body and save it. This application was built using node.js, express, and file system as well as using the path and uuid packages and the nodemon package for developer use. The reason I did this application was so I can have a note saver application that was responsive and simple as well as learning to how to create an application using back-end and front-end software. I learned how to use node.js and express to create a server on the backend and make routes on the website and I learned how to install packages in the package.json, use them and integrate them in the server.js to create an overall functional back-end application. I also learned how to use the heroku website and how to deploy my applications via heroku.

## Installation

To install this application, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine. However if you just want to view the website, then you can click on the heroku deployment link.

## Usage

To use the note saver application, you will first click on the button in the middle of the home page. That will take you to the notes page. On the page, you can see three sample notes already provided to see how the notes will appear on the page. You can click on the note titles themselves to view the whole note with the title and body present. To make a new note, you will press the plus sign on the top-right of the page. This will allow you to create a new note with a title and body text. After you added your contents, you can hit the save button next to the plus sign on the top-right of the page to save your note. You must refresh the page to view the new note you created. A future update will occur that will handle the page refresh automatically and also allow you to delete the notes.
